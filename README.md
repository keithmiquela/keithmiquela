## About Me

I’m a backend- and systems-oriented software engineer with a strong interest in building **reliable, scalable systems** and understanding software from the ground up. I enjoy working close to infrastructure, data, and APIs, and I’m constantly looking for opportunities to deepen my systems knowledge.

I value clean design, strong abstractions, and learning by building. Beyond code, I enjoy leading teams, mentoring peers, and contributing to projects with real-world impact.
